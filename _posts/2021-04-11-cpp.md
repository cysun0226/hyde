# Network Programming

Projects of the Network Programming course @ CS NCTU 2019 fall.

## 1. npshell
Implement a Shell with special piping mechanisms. [[spec]](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~cysun0226/np-spec/NP_Project1_Spec.pdf)

## 2. chat room
Design a chat-like system server. [[spec]](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~cysun0226/np-spec/NP_Project2_Spec.pdf)

* Concurrent connection-oriented: allows clients to connect & execute shells
* Chat-like system: Message sending (between users or broadcast), piping content between users, etc.
    * Single-process concurrent
    * Multi-process (fifo + shared memory)

# STM32 Microcontroller - Remote Cooker
The term project of the course Microprocessor System Lab @ NCTU CS 2017 fall.

We developed wifi remote & sensor monitoring functions for a ordinary cooker based on a STM32  development board (`arm NUCLEO-L476RG`). [[Github]](https://github.com/cysun0226/intelligent-cook)

# Gobang AI
Build a Gobang AI by implementing the minimax game tree & design utility functions. [[Github]](https://github.com/cysun0226/Artifical-Intelligence/tree/master/game-project/game-AI)
